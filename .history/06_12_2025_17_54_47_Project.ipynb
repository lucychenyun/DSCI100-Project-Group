    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A research group at The Pacific Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence at UBC is running a large-scale data-collection project using a custom Minecraft server. The aim of the project is to track and determine factors which influence player behaviour, which the server logs as participants moving through the game world, generating a rich dataset for modelling human decision-making. Managing this project requires more than the setup of the server, but also strategic recruitment of participants, and to secure the necessary infrastructure to support the volume of incoming players. Ultimately, generated datasets from the server and players must be analyzed to determine the following broad questions posed by the group. \n",

    "\n",
    "To evaluate which value of k works best, we used 5-fold cross-validation on the training data. Cross-validation splits the data into five parts, trains the model on four of them, and tests it on the remaining part. This process repeats so each fold is used for testing once, giving a more reliable estimate of model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We tested k-values from 1 to 10 using a tuning grid. The `tune_grid()` function fit the model for each k across all folds and collected performance metrics. After tuning, we filtered the results to keep only the accuracy values, allowing us to compare how accuracy changes with different numbers of neighbours.\n",
